Bring your BeamNG.drive world to life with Dynamic Rain, a simple yet powerful mod that adds randomized rainstorms to most maps. This mod simulates weather variation by making it rain at unpredictable intervals — complete with cloud cover, ambient rain sound, and support for various rain object names across official maps like West Coast USA and more.

Features
• Dynamic rain that starts and stops at random
• Built-in rain sounds from the game
• Automatic cloud density control for atmospheric realism
• Auto-detection of rain objects across multiple maps
• A key to activate the rain

How to use:
Press Alt + R to activate the rain. The key can be changed by going to Options > Controls > Dynamic Rain.

To use it put it in C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\BeamNG.drive\the_game_version\mods

Enjoy!

Notes
This is my first Lua mod for BeamNG.drive. Feedback would be greatly appreciated so I can improve or expand it in the future!

Cloud cover does not work to download the fixed version go to: https://www.beamng.com/resources/dynamic-rain.34597/

This will not work with all maps, but it will work with most maps. If you are using this on a custom map it will not work unless the map has an object named "rain_coverage" and it is a Precipitation object.
