Bring your BeamNG.drive world to life with Dynamic Rain, a simple yet powerful mod that adds randomized rainstorms to most maps. This mod simulates weather variation by making it rain at unpredictable intervals. It includes ambient rain sounds, and support for various rain object names across official maps like West Coast USA and more.

Features
• Dynamic rain that starts and stops at random
• Built-in rain sounds from the game
• Auto-detection of rain objects across multiple maps
• A key to activate the rain

How to use:
Press Alt + R to activate the rain. The key can be changed by going to Options > Controls > Dynamic Rain.

Enjoy! :)

Notes
This is my first Lua mod for BeamNG.drive. Feedback would be greatly appreciated so I can improve or expand it in the future!

If you want the fixed version download the file titled dynamicRain_v1.1_jtf.zip

This will not work with all maps, but it will work with most maps. If you are using this on a custom map it will not work unless the map has an object named "rain_coverage" and it is a Precipitation object.
